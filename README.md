## Project Overview

**RakshakRita** is a platform designed to empower citizens by providing them with a voice to express their opinions and concerns. It serves as a bridge between the public and law enforcement, ensuring that citizen feedback is not only heard but also acted upon. This README provides an overview of the project and its features.

## How It Works

**Rakshakrita** operates on a simple yet effective process:

1. **Access the Platform**: Users can voice their opinions by scanning the QR code, which redirects them to the official Rakshakrita website.

2. **User Registration and Anonymity**: For first-time users, a unique ID is generated to distinguish between users without compromising anonymity. The user's location is verified within a 100-meter radius of the police station to ensure local relevance.

3. **Multilingual Support**: Rakshakrita supports multiple languages, allowing users to express themselves in the language they are most comfortable with.

4. **User-Friendly Feedback Form**: The feedback form provides a user-friendly experience, offering an array of options. Users fill in a mandatory field describing their problem, answer objective questions, and can use speech-to-text or attach media for more detailed feedback.

5. **Machine Learning Analysis**: Feedback elements undergo analysis through a machine learning model, categorizing descriptions as positive or negative. The results are stored in a database for authorities to review and generate reports.

6. **Additional Features**:
    - Feedback Reports: Users can view reports highlighting the public opinion on different police stations.
    - [Live Heatmaps](https://github.com/vaxad/RJPOLICE_HACK_177_DjDawgs_1/blob/main/resources/impCodes/heatmapData.py): Visual representation of the intensity of negative feedback for various localities.

7. **Periodic Reports to Higher Authorities**: Regular reports are sent to higher authorities via the mobile app and [mail](https://github.com/vaxad/RJPOLICE_HACK_177_DjDawgs_1/blob/main/resources/impCodes/pdfMailing.js), providing detailed insights into police stations under their jurisdictions. This aids in identifying and addressing potential issues promptly.

## Website

1. Users can **scan the QR codes** stuck outside police stations via our website/any QR code scanner; they will then be redirected to the feedback form of that particular police station on the website.
2. Users are shown their distance from the police station using **live maps**.
3. Users can submit their feedback by typing or using the **speech recognition** feature on the website(available in Hindi as well as English).
4. A **customizable form** (only by police authorities) is also available to fill for the users.
5. Users can view the **performance** of their nearby police stations.
6. **Live heatmaps** showing the distribution of negative feedbacks is also available.
